## Car Model Classification Problem

Classifying cars into their specific model (ex, Acura RL Sedan 2012) is much harder than classifying cats vs dogs.

This competition measures how accurately your model can classify car images into 196 different classes.

### main purpose of this work
1. understand different methods/frameworks/models that can be used for multiclass image classification
2. look into different types of neural net layers and optimizers
3. learn more about keras and potentially other frameworks as well (fast.ai)
